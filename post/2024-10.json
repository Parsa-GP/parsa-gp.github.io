        "content": "So I was in one of my friends' home and he had an extension for removing recommendations.\n\nat the time I hadn't a problem. But with the help of another extension, it reported that I watch NEARLY 70+ FUCKING VIDEOS **PER DAY**!\n\nI don't use < 1 minute videos (yt shorts, IG reels, tikTok) so most of my videos are longer than 20min.\n\nSo I decided to use a strategy that I created\n\n\n1. open youtube\nit shows your recommendations\n2. click and open videos with your middle mouse click to open the video in a new tab\ncongratulations! You've made a mess!\n3. Watch the first video\n4. After that before switching to the next tab, hover your mouse on the tab name to see the full title of the video\nand press with the middle mouse again to close tabs you don't want to watch\n\nThe strategy is choosing which video you want to watch without any thumbnails, seeing who it is (like if it was X's video, without thinking, \"I have to watch it when I don't need to). The reason you have to watch a video before managing the videos you want to watch is that you forget you are in an infinite scroll of recommendations and have to choose between the videos you want to watch.\n\n\n![youtube tabs example](../assets/post_media/tabs.jxl)\n\n\nSo I am much more productive with the help of this strategy.\n\nIt's better than removing the thumbnail because you get a peek at the video before playing it fully (the whole purpose of a thumbnail)\n\nAnd it's better than removing the recommendation because it's Denial of the problem statement (we have a Persian thing for it: \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0645\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u067e\u0627\u06a9 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646)\n\n"
